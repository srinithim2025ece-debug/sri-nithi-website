<section><h2>DEFINITION OF SUBSCRIPTION BOX</h2>
A subscription box is a recurring delivery of products, usually on a monthly basis, that customers pay for in advance. These boxes are often themed around a specific interest, like beauty or food, and contain a curated selection of items, which may be a surprise or a personalized set of favorites. The business model provides convenience for customers to discover new products or receive refills and offers businesses a predictable, recurring revenue stream.  
How it works
Recurring Payments: Customers are billed on a regular schedule (monthly, quarterly, etc.) to receive their boxes. 
Curated or Replenishment: Boxes can either offer new, curated products around a theme (like beauty samples) or provide replenishments of items the customer already uses (like coffee beans). 
Delivery: The physical products are packaged in a box and delivered directly to the customer's doorstep. 
Benefits
For Customers: Discovery of new products, convenient delivery, and potential cost savings. 
For Businesses: Predictable revenue, increased customer loyalty, and a way to gather data on customer preferences.
